# recursion-city
The idea is a menu driven program to perform queue operations for a line of cars waiting to order at a drive thru.
Recursion is used to perform three of the queue operations:
  1. Count the cars in line.
  2. Search for the car with the most kids and put them at the front of the queue.
  3. Find a friend's name in line and put them to the front of the queue.
